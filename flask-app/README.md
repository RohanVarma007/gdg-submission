# My First Flask Login System

Hi! This is my first Flask project. It's a simple login system where users can:
- Login with their name
- See their profile
- Logout

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`
