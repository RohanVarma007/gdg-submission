# My GDG Projects

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is my submission for GDG. I made two cool projects:

1. Sehatrra - A website where doctors and patients can talk online
2. Voting System - A simple program to handle voting

## How to Run

- For Sehatrra: Go to the Sehatrra folder and follow instructions in its README
- For Voting System: Just run main.py with Python

That's it! Hope you like my projects! ðŸ˜Š
